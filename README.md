Flite Price Prediction

📌 Overview

The Flite Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately forecasts flight ticket prices. Given the increasing demand for air travel and the highly dynamic nature of ticket pricing, a reliable predictive model can assist travelers in making informed booking decisions and optimizing their travel expenses.

🚀 Problem Statement

The airline industry operates in a competitive and constantly changing environment, where ticket prices fluctuate frequently due to multiple factors, including:

Demand and supply

Seasonal trends

Fuel prices

Airline competition

Time of booking

These unpredictable variations make it challenging for travelers to plan and budget their trips effectively. The goal of this project is to build a robust machine learning model that can predict flight prices with high accuracy, enabling users to make cost-effective travel choices.

🎯 Objectives

Collect and preprocess historical flight data, including departure/arrival locations, dates, airlines, and other influencing factors.

Analyze trends and correlations in flight pricing.

Develop and train machine learning models to forecast flight prices.

Evaluate the models using appropriate performance metrics.

Deploy the final model to assist users in estimating ticket prices before booking.
